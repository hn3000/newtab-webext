
# A very minimal new-tab extension

This extension should work as a very minimal new tab override 
in both Firefox and Chrome.

It loads in Edge, but Edge doesn't support it's core function.


The main advantage of this extension over others is it's size, it has less than 220 lines of (easily reviewed) code.
